<h1>Yojigen</h1>
<p>Yojigen is an ease-to-use bootstrap framework based on Jekyll and Zurb Foundation. You can easily create and browse documents and the whole site is generated to reflect any changes. The Foundation default theme has been altered a little to align with <a href="http://sitcon.org">SITCON 2013</a> accent, as an administration flow proof-of-concept.</p>
